# Anti-aliased-Ray-Tracing

A ray tracing system which parses 3D scene described with orientation of geometric primitives and allows the user to explore in real-time the CPU based ray traced scene with ultra high realism.

Features
--------
- CPU based ray tracer built from scratch.
- Users can explore the ray-traced world in real-time using keyboard control.
- Parallelises the task of tracing ray by using all of the available CPU cores.
- Provides a framework that can be expanded with new geometric primitives which enables it to be able to render more complex scenes.
- Anti-aliasing level can be controlled.

Dependencies
------------
The project requires:
- Java SE 7
